# Elasticsearch monitoring with Netdata

[`Elasticsearch`](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/) is a search engine based on the Lucene library.

This module monitors one or more `Elasticsearch` instances, depending on your configuration.

Used endpoints:

- Local node metrics: `/_nodes/_local/stats`
- Local node indices' metrics: `/_cat/indices?local=true`
- Cluster health metrics: `/_cluster/health`
- Cluster metrics: `/_cluster/stats`

Each endpoint can be enabled/disabled in the module configuration file.

## Charts

Number of charts depends on enabled endpoints.

### Cluster Stats

- Cluster Indices Count in `indices`
- Cluster Indices Shards Count in `shards`
- Cluster Indices Docs Count in `docs`
- Cluster Indices Store Size in `bytes`
- Cluster Indices Query Cache in `events/s`
- Cluster Nodes By Role Count in `nodes`

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/elasticsearch.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the
Netdata [config directory](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/configure/nodes), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/elasticsearch.conf
```

To add a new endpoint to collect metrics from, or change the URL that Netdata looks for, add or configure the `name` and
`url` values. Endpoints can be both local or remote as long as they expose their metrics on the provided URL.

Here is an example with two endpoints:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    url: http://127.0.0.1:9200

  - name: remote
    url: http://203.0.113.0:9200
```

For all available options, see the Elasticsearch
collector's [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/elasticsearch.conf).

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `elasticsearch` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The
output should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

First, navigate to your plugins' directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on your
system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the setting `plugins directory`. Once you're in the plugin's directory, switch
to the `netdata` user.

```bash
cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
sudo -u netdata -s
```

You can now run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

```bash
./go.d.plugin -d -m elasticsearch
```
