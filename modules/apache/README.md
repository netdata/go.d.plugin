# Apache monitoring with Netdata

[`Apache`](https://httpd.apache.org/) is an open-source HTTP server for modern operating systems including UNIX and
Windows.

This module will monitor one or more `Apache` servers, depending on your configuration.

## Requirements

- `Apache` with enabled [`mod_status`](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html)

## Metrics

All metrics have "apache." prefix.

| Metric      | Scope  |                                                 Dimensions                                                  |    Units    |
|-------------|:------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------:|
| connections | global |                                                 connections                                                 | connections |
| conns_async | global |                                         keepalive, closing, writing                                         | connections |
| workers     | global |                                                 idle, busy                                                  |   workers   |
| scoreboard  | global | waiting, starting, reading, sending, keepalive, dns_lookup, closing, logging, finishing, idle_cleanup, open | connections |
| requests    | global |                                                  requests                                                   | requests/s  |
| net         | global |                                                    sent                                                     |  kilobit/s  |
| reqpersec   | global |                                                  requests                                                   | requests/s  |
| bytespersec | global |                                                   served                                                    |    KiB/s    |
| bytesperreq | global |                                                    size                                                     |     KiB     |
| uptime      | global |                                                   uptime                                                    |   seconds   |

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/apache.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the
Netdata [config directory](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/configure/nodes), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/apache.conf
```

Needs only `url` to server's `server-status?auto`. Here is an example for 2 servers:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    url: http://127.0.0.1/server-status?auto

  - name: remote
    url: http://203.0.113.10/server-status?auto
```

For all available options please see
module [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/apache.conf).

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `apache` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m apache
  ```
