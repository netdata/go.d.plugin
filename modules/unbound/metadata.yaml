    description: |
      [Unbound](https://nlnetlabs.nl/projects/unbound/about/) is a validating, recursive, and caching DNS resolver product
      from NLnet Labs.
  collector:
    description: |
      This collector monitors one or more Unbound servers, depending on your configuration.
setup:
  prerequisites:
    list:
      - title: Enable remote control interface
        text: |
          Set `control-enable` to yes in [unbound.conf](https://nlnetlabs.nl/documentation/unbound/unbound.conf).
      - title: Check permissions and adjust if necessary
        text: |
          If using unix socket:

          - socket should be readable and writeable by `netdata` user

          If using ip socket and TLS is disabled:

          - socket should be accessible via network

          If TLS is enabled, in addition:

          - `control-key-file` should be readable by `netdata` user
          - `control-cert-file` should be readable by `netdata` user

          For auto-detection parameters from `unbound.conf`:

          - `unbound.conf` should be readable by `netdata` user
          - if you have several configuration files (include feature) all of them should be readable by `netdata` user
  configuration:
    options:

        The following options can be defined globally: update_every, autodetection_retry.
