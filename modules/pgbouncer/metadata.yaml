overview:
  application:
    description: |
      [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/) is an open-source connection pooler
      for [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).
  collector:
    description: |
      This collector monitors one or more PgBouncer servers, depending on your configuration.

      Executed queries:

      - `SHOW VERSION;`
      - `SHOW CONFIG;`
      - `SHOW DATABASES;`
      - `SHOW STATS;`
      - `SHOW POOLS;`

      Information about the queries can be found in the [PgBouncer Documentation](http://pgbouncer.org/usage.html).
setup:
  prerequisites:
    list:
      - title: Create netdata user
        text: |
          Create a user with `stats_users` permissions to query your PgBouncer instance.
          
          To create the `netdata` user:
          
          - Add `netdata` user to the `pgbouncer.ini` file:
          
            ```text
            stats_users = netdata
            ```
          
          - Add a password for the `netdata` user to the `userlist.txt` file:
          
            ```text
            "netdata" "<PASSWORD>"
            ```
          
          - To verify the credentials, run the following command
          
            ```bash
            psql -h localhost -U netdata -p 6432 pgbouncer -c "SHOW VERSION;" >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo OK || echo FAIL
            ```
          
            When it prompts for a password, enter the password you added to `userlist.txt`.
