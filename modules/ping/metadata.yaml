    description: |
      This module measures round-tripe time and packet loss by sending ping messages to network hosts.
      
      There are two operational modes:

      - privileged (send raw ICMP ping, default). Requires
        CAP_NET_RAW [capability](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html) or root privileges:
        > **Note**: set automatically during Netdata installation.

        ```bash
        sudo setcap CAP_NET_RAW=eip <INSTALL_PREFIX>/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/go.d.plugin
        ```

      - unprivileged (send UDP ping, Linux only).
        Requires configuring [ping_group_range](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/icmp.7.html):

        ```bash
        sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 2147483647"
        ```
        To persist the change add `net.ipv4.ping_group_range="0 2147483647"` to `/etc/sysctl.conf` and
        execute `sudo sysctl -p`.
