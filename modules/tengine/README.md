# Tengine monitoring with Netdata

[`Tengine`](https://tengine.taobao.org/) is a web server originated by Taobao, the largest e-commerce website in Asia.
It is based on the Nginx HTTP server and has many advanced features.

This module monitors one or more `Tengine` instances, depending on your configuration.

## Requirements

- `tengine` with configured [`ngx_http_reqstat_module`](http://tengine.taobao.org/document/http_reqstat.html).
- collector expects [default line format](http://tengine.taobao.org/document/http_reqstat.html).

## Charts

It produces the following summary charts:

- Bandwidth in `B/s`
- Connections in `connections/s`
- Requests in `requests/s`
- Requests Per Response Code Family in `requests/s`
- Requests Per Response Code Detailed in `requests/s`
- Number Of Requests Calling For Upstream in `requests/s`
- Number Of Times Calling For Upstream in `calls/s`
- Requests Per Response Code Family in `requests/s`

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/tengine.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the
Netdata [config directory](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/configure/nodes), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/tengine.conf
```

Needs only `url` to server's `/us`. Here is an example for 2 servers:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    url: http://127.0.0.1/us

  - name: remote
    url: http://203.0.113.10/us
```

For all available options please see
module [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/tengine.conf).

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `tengine` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m tengine
  ```
