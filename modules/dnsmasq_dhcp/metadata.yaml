title: Dnsmasq DHCP collector
overview:
  application:
    description: |
      [Dnsmasq](https://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder, designed to provide DNS (and optionally DHCP and TFTP) services to a small-scale network.
  collector:
    description: |
      This collector monitors one or more Dnsmasq DHCP leases databases, depending on your configuration.

      By default, it uses:

      - `/var/lib/misc/dnsmasq.leases` to read leases.
      - `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` to detect dhcp-ranges.
      - `/etc/dnsmasq.d` to find additional configurations.

      All configured dhcp-ranges are detected automatically.
