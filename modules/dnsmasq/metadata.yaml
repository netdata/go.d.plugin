      [Dnsmasq](https://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) is a lightweight, easy to configure DNS forwarder, designed to provide DNS (and optionally DHCP and TFTP) services to a small-scale network.
  collector:
    description: |
      This collector monitors one or more Dnsmasq DNS Forwarder instances, depending on your configuration.

      It collects DNS cache statistics by [reading the response on the following query](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/dnsmasq-base/dnsmasq.8.en.html#NOTES):

      ```cmd
      ;; opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 37862
