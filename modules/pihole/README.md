# Pi-hole monitoring with Netdata

[`Pi-hole`](https://pi-hole.net) is a Linux network-level advertisement and Internet tracker blocking application which
acts as a DNS sinkhole, intended for use on a private network.

This module will monitor one or more `Pi-hole` instances using [PHP API](https://github.com/pi-hole/AdminLTE).

The API exposed data time frame is `for the last 24 hr`. All collected values are for that time frame, not for the
module collection interval.

## Charts

It produces the following set of charts:

- DNS Queries Total (Cached, Blocked and Forwarded) in `queries`
- DNS Queries in `queries`
- DNS Queries Percentage in `percentage`
- Unique Clients in `clients`
- Domains On Blocklist in `domains`
- Blocklist Last Update in `seconds`
- Unwanted Domains Blocking Status in `boolean`

If the web password is set and valid following charts will be added:

- DNS Queries Per Type in `percentage`
- DNS Queries Per Destination in `percentage`
- Top Clients in `requests`
- Top Permitted Domains in `hits`
- Top Blocked Domains in `hits`

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/pihole.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the
Netdata [config directory](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/configure/nodes), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/pihole.conf
```

Module automatically detects `Pihole` web password reading `setupVars.conf` file. It expects to find the file in
the `/etc/pihole/` directory.

If you want to monitor remote instance you need to set the password in the module configuration file.

Here is an example for local and remote instances:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    top_clients_entries: 10
    top_items_entries: 10  # top permitted and top blocked domains charts

  - name: remote
    url: http://203.0.113.10
    password: 1ebd33f882f9aa5fac26a7cb74704742f91100228eb322e41b7bd6e6aeb8f74b

  - name: remote_https
    url: https://203.0.113.11
    password: 1ebd33f882f9aa5fac26a7cb74704742f91100228eb322e41b7bd6e6aeb8f74b
    tls_skip_verify: yes  # self signed certificate verification skip

```

For all available options please see
module [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/pihole.conf).

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `pihole` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

First, navigate to your plugins' directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on your
system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the setting `plugins directory`. Once you're in the plugin's directory, switch
to the `netdata` user.

```bash
cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
sudo -u netdata -s
```

You can now run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

```bash
./go.d.plugin -d -m pihole
```
