# vCenter Server monitoring with Netdata

[`VMware vCenter Server`](https://www.vmware.com/products/vcenter-server.html) is advanced server management software
that provides a centralized platform for controlling your VMware vSphere environments.

This module collects hosts and vms performance statistics from one or more `vCenter` servers depending on configuration.

> **Warning**: The `vsphere` collector cannot re-login and continue collecting metrics after a vCenter reboot.
> go.d.plugin needs to be restarted.

## Charts

It produces the following charts:

#### Virtual Machine

- VMKernel Memory Swap Rate in `KiB/s`
- VMKernel Memory Swap in `KiB`
- Network Bandwidth Total in `KiB/s`

- Network Drops Total in `packets`
- Network Errors Total in `errors`
- Disk Usage Total in `KiB/s`
- Disk Max Latency in `ms`
- Overall Alarm Status in `status`
- System Uptime in `seconds`

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/vsphere.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the
Netdata [config directory](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/configure/nodes), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/vsphere.conf
```

Needs only `url`, `username` and `password`. Here is an example for 2 servers:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: vcenter1
    url: https://203.0.113.0
    username: admin@vsphere.local
    password: somepassword
    host_include: ['/*']
    vm_include: ['/*']

  - name: vcenter2
    url: https://203.0.113.10
    username: admin@vsphere.local
    password: somepassword
    host_include: ['/*']
    vm_include: ['/*']
```

For all available options please see
module [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/vsphere.conf).

## Hosts/vms filtering

Module supports filtering hosts and vms. Filtering options are `host_include` and `vm_include`.

- `host_include` is a list of match patterns: `/Dc pattern[/Cluster pattern/Host pattern]`.
- `vm_include` is a list of match patterns: `/Dc pattern[/Cluster pattern/Host pattern/VM name]`.

Pattern should start with `/`. It matches name,
syntax: [simple patterns](https://docs.netdata.cloud/libnetdata/simple_pattern/).

Examples:

```yaml
    host_include: # filter all hosts
      - '/!*'
    vm_include: # allow all vms
      - '/*'
```

```yaml

host_include: # allow all DC1 datacenter hosts and DC2 datacenter hosts except HOST2
  - '/DC1/*'
  - '/DC2/*/!HOST2 *'
vm_include: # allow all vms from datacenters whose names starts with DC1 and from all hosts except HOST1 and HOST2
  - '/DC1*/*/!HOST1 !HOST2 */*'
```  

## Update every

Default `update_every` is 20 seconds, and it doesn't make sense to decrease the value. **VMware real-time statistics are
generated at the 20-seconds specificity**.

It is likely that 20 seconds is not enough for big installations and the value should be tuned.

To get better view we recommend to run the collector in debug mode and see how much time it will take to collect
metrics.

Example (all not related debug lines were removed):

```
[ilyam@pc]$ ./go.d.plugin -d -m vsphere
[ DEBUG ] vsphere[vsphere] discover.go:94 discovering : starting resource discovering process
[ DEBUG ] vsphere[vsphere] discover.go:102 discovering : found 3 dcs, process took 49.329656ms

[ DEBUG ] vsphere[vsphere] collect.go:23 metrics collected, process took 154.77997ms

```

There you can see that discovering took `525.614041ms`, collecting metrics took `154.77997ms`. Discovering is a separate
thread, it doesn't affect collecting.

`update_every` and `timeout` parameters should be adjusted based on these numbers.

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `vsphere` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

First, navigate to your plugins' directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on your
system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the setting `plugins directory`. Once you're in the plugin's directory, switch
to the `netdata` user.

```bash
cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
sudo -u netdata -s
```

You can now run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

```bash
./go.d.plugin -d -m vsphere
```
