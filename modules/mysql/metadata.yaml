title: MySQL collector
overview:
  application:
    description: |
      [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source relational database management system.
  collector:
    description: |
      This collector monitors one or more MySQL servers, depending on your configuration.
      
      Executed queries:

      - `SELECT VERSION();`
      - `SHOW GLOBAL STATUS;`
      - `SHOW GLOBAL VARIABLES;`
      - `SHOW SLAVE STATUS;` or `SHOW ALL SLAVES STATUS;` (MariaDBv10.2+)
      - `SHOW USER_STATISTICS;` (MariaDBv10.1.1+)
      - `SELECT TIME,USER FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PROCESSLIST;`

      - title: Create netdata user
        text: |
          A user account should have the
          following [permissions](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html):

          - [`USAGE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_usage)
          - [`REPLICATION CLIENT`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_replication-client)
          - [`PROCESS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_process)
          
          To create the `netdata` user with these permissions, execute the following in the MySQL shell:

          ```mysql
          CREATE USER 'netdata'@'localhost';
          GRANT USAGE, REPLICATION CLIENT, PROCESS ON *.* TO 'netdata'@'localhost';
          FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
          ```
          
          The `netdata` user will have the ability to connect to the MySQL server on localhost without a password. It will only
          be able to gather statistics without being able to alter or affect operations in any way.
