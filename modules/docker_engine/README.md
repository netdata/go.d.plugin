# Docker Engine monitoring with Netdata

[`Docker Engine`](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) is the industryâ€™s de facto container runtime that runs on various
Linux (CentOS, Debian, Fedora, Oracle Linux, RHEL, SUSE, and Ubuntu) and Windows Server operating systems.

This module will monitor one or more `Docker Engines` applications, depending on your configuration.

## Requirements

- Docker with enabled [`metric-address`](https://docs.docker.com/config/thirdparty/prometheus/)

## Charts

It produces the following charts:

- Container Actions in `actions/s`
- Container States in `containers`
- Builder Builds Fails By Reason in `fails/s`
- Health Checks in `events/s`

If Docker is running in [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) and the instance is a Swarm manager:

- Swarm Manager Leader in `bool`
- Swarm Manager Object Store in `count`
- Swarm Manager Nodes Per State in `count`
- Swarm Manager Tasks Per State in `count`

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/docker_engine.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the
Netdata [config directory](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/configure/nodes), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/docker_engine.conf
```

Needs only `url` to docker `metric-address`. Here is an example for 2 docker instances:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    url: http://127.0.0.1:9323/metrics

  - name: remote
    url: http://203.0.113.10:9323/metrics
```

For all available options, please see the
module's [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/docker_engine.conf).

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `docker_engine` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The
output should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

First, navigate to your plugins' directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on your
system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the setting `plugins directory`. Once you're in the plugin's directory, switch
to the `netdata` user.

```bash
cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
sudo -u netdata -s
```

You can now run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

```bash
./go.d.plugin -d -m docker_engine
```
