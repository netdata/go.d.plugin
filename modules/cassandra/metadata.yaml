      - title: Configure Cassandra with Prometheus JMX Exporter
        text: |
          To configure Cassandra with the [JMX Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter):

          > **Note**: paths can differ depends on your setup.

          - Download latest [jmx_exporter](https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/prometheus/jmx/jmx_prometheus_javaagent/) jar file
            and install it in a directory where Cassandra can access it.
          - Add
            the [jmx_exporter.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/master/modules/cassandra/jmx_exporter.yaml)
            file to `/etc/cassandra`.
          - Add the following line to `/etc/cassandra/cassandra-env.sh`
            ```
            JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS $JVM_EXTRA_OPTS -javaagent:/opt/jmx_exporter/jmx_exporter.jar=7072:/etc/cassandra/jmx_exporter.yaml
            ```
          - Restart cassandra service.
