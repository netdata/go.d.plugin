# MongoDB monitoring with Netdata

[`MongoDB`](https://www.mongodb.com/) MongoDB is a source-available cross-platform document-oriented database program.
Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with optional schemas. MongoDB is developed by
MongoDB Inc. and licensed under the Server Side Public License (SSPL).

---

This module monitors one or more `MongoDB` instances, depending on your configuration.

It collects information and statistics about the server executing the following commands:

- [`serverStatus`](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/serverStatus/#mongodb-dbcommand-dbcmd.serverStatus)

command to monitor the database. Based on the command output the following may be included:

#### Active Clients

- readers in `clients`

reports [global locks active clients](https://docs.mongodb.com/v5.0/reference/command/serverStatus/#globallock)

### [Database Statistics](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/dbStats/#dbstats)

Stack chart that include per database metrics for collections, indexes, views, documents and disk size. Because
internally the module has to run the
`dbstats` commands once per database and each server may have a large number of databases, these charts are disabled by
default. To enabled them please use
a [matcher](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/agent/collectors/go.d.plugin/pkg/matcher)
in the configuration file to enable the collection for specific or all databases.

For example, to exclude the admin and config databases use:

```yaml
 databases:
   includes:
     - "* *"
   excludes:
     - "= config"
     - "= admin"
```

#### [Collections](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/dbStats/#mongodb-data-dbStats.collections)

Number of collections per database in `collections`

#### [Indexes](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/dbStats/#mongodb-data-dbStats.indexes)

Number of indexes per database in `indexes`

#### [Views](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/dbStats/#mongodb-data-dbStats.views)

Number of views per database in `views`

#### [Documents](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/dbStats/#mongodb-data-dbStats.objects)

Number of documents per database in `documents`

#### [Disk Size](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/dbStats/#mongodb-data-dbStats.dataSize)

Total space allocated to all collections in the database for document storage(including free space) in `bytes`

### Replication

Charts are available on replica sets only.

#### Replication lag

Time when last entry from the oplog was applied for every member in `milliseconds`

#### Replication set member heartbeat latency

Time when last heartbeat was received from replica set member `milliseconds`

#### Ping

Round trip time between members and local instance in `milliseconds`

### Sharding

Charts are available on shards only
for [mongos](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/serverStatus/#mongodb-serverstatus-serverstatus.process)

#### Transaction Commit Types

Number of initiated and successful `no shard`, `single shard`, `shard write` ,`two phase`commits in `commits`

#### Shard Nodes

Number of shard aware vs shard unaware nodes in `nodes`

#### Databases Sharding Status

Partitioned vs UnPartitioned databases in `databases`

#### Collections Sharding Status

Partitioned vs UnPartitioned collections in `databases`

#### Chucks Per Node

Number of chucks per node in `chunks`

## Prerequisites

Create a read-only user for Netdata in the admin database.

- Authenticate as the admin user.

  ```
  use admin
  db.auth("admin", "<MONGODB_ADMIN_PASSWORD>")
  ```

- Create a user.

```
# MongoDB 2.x.
db.addUser("netdata", "<UNIQUE_PASSWORD>", true)

# MongoDB 3.x or higher.
db.createUser({
  "user":"netdata",
  "pwd": "<UNIQUE_PASSWORD>",
  "roles" : [
    {role: 'read', db: 'admin' },
    {role: 'clusterMonitor', db: 'admin'},
    {role: 'read', db: 'local' }
  ]
})
```

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/mongodb.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the
Netdata [config directory](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/configure/nodes), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata   # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory, if different
sudo ./edit-config go.d/mongodb.conf
```

Sample using connection string:

**This is the preferred way**

```yaml
uri: 'mongodb://localhost:27017'
```

If no configuration is given, module will attempt to connect to mongodb daemon on `127.0.0.1:27017` address

For all available options, see the `mongodb`
collector's [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/mongodb.conf).

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `mongodb` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m mongodb
  ```
