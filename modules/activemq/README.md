# ActiveMQ monitoring with Netdata

[`ActiveMQ`](https://activemq.apache.org/) is an open source message broker written in Java together with a full Java
Message Service client.

This plugin collects queues and topics metrics using ActiveMQ Console API.

## Charts

It produces following charts per queue and per topic:

- Messages in `messages/s`
- Unprocessed Messages in `messages`
- Consumers in `consumers`

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/activemq.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the
Netdata [config directory](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/configure/nodes), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/activemq.conf
```

Here is an example for 2 servers:

```yaml
jobs:
  - name: local
    url: http://127.0.0.1:8161
    webadmin: admin
    max_queues: 100
    max_topics: 100
    queues_filter: '!sandr* *'
    topics_filter: '!sandr* *'

  - name: remote
    url: http://203.0.113.10:8161
    webadmin: admin
```

For all available options, please see the
module [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/activemq.conf).

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `activemq` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

First, navigate to your plugins' directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on your
system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the setting `plugins directory`. Once you're in the plugin's directory, switch
to the `netdata` user.

```bash
cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
sudo -u netdata -s
```

You can now run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

```bash
./go.d.plugin -d -m activemq
```
