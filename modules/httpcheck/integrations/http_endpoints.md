# HTTP Endpoints

Plugin: go.d.plugin
Module: httpcheck

<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20by-Netdata-%2300ab44" />

## Overview

This collector monitors HTTP servers availability and response time.




This collector is supported on all platforms.

This collector supports collecting metrics from multiple instances of this integration, including remote instances.


### Default Behavior

#### Auto-Detection

This integration doesn't support auto-detection.

#### Limits

The default configuration for this integration does not impose any limits on data collection.

#### Performance Impact

The default configuration for this integration is not expected to impose a significant performance impact on the system.


## Metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.



### Per target

The metrics refer to the monitored target.

Labels:

| Label      | Description     |
|:-----------|:----------------|
| url | url value that is set in the configuration file. |

Metrics:

| Metric | Dimensions | Unit |
|:------|:----------|:----|
| httpcheck.response_time | time | ms |
| httpcheck.response_length | length | characters |
| httpcheck.status | success, no_connection, timeout, bad_content, bad_status | boolean |
| httpcheck.in_state | time | boolean |



## Alerts

There are no alerts configured by default for this integration.


## Setup

### Prerequisites

No action required.

### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name for this integration is `go.d/httpcheck.conf`.


You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config go.d/httpcheck.conf
```
#### Options

The following options can be defined globally: update_every, autodetection_retry.


<details><summary>Config options</summary>

| Name | Description | Default | Required |
|:----|:-----------|:-------|:--------:|
| update_every | Data collection frequency. |  | False |
| autodetection_retry | Recheck interval in seconds. Zero means no recheck will be scheduled. |  | False |
| url | Server URL. |  | True |
| status_accepted | HTTP accepted response statuses. Anything else will result in 'bad status' in the status chart. |  | False |
| response_match | If the status code is accepted, the content of the response will be matched against this regular expression. |  | False |
| cookie_file | Path to cookie file. See [cookie file format](https://everything.curl.dev/http/cookies/fileformat). |  | False |
| timeout | HTTP request timeout. |  | False |
| username | Username for basic HTTP authentication. |  | False |
| password | Password for basic HTTP authentication. |  | False |
| proxy_url | Proxy URL. |  | False |
| proxy_username | Username for proxy basic HTTP authentication. |  | False |
| proxy_password | Password for proxy basic HTTP authentication. |  | False |
| method | HTTP request method. |  | False |

## Troubleshooting

### Debug Mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `httpcheck` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m httpcheck
  ```
