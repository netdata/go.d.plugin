# Supervisord monitoring with Netdata

[Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/) is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and control a number of
processes on UNIX-like operating systems.

This module monitors one or more Supervisor instances, depending on your configuration.

It can collect metrics from
both [unix socket](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html?highlight=unix_http_server#unix-http-server-section-values)
and [internal http server](http://supervisord.org/configuration.html?highlight=unix_http_server#inet-http-server-section-settings)

Used methods:

- [`supervisor.getAllProcessInfo`](http://supervisord.org/api.html#supervisor.rpcinterface.SupervisorNamespaceRPCInterface.getAllProcessInfo)

## Charts

Summary charts:

- Processes in `processes`

Processes groups charts:

- Processes in `processes`
- State code in `code`
- Exit status in `status`
- Uptime in `seconds`
- Downtime in `seconds`

## Configuration

Edit the `go.d/supervisord.conf` configuration file using `edit-config` from the
Netdata [config directory](https://learn.netdata.cloud/docs/configure/nodes), which is typically at `/etc/netdata`.

```bash
cd /etc/netdata # Replace this path with your Netdata config directory
sudo ./edit-config go.d/supervisord.conf
```

Endpoints can be both local or remote as long as they expose their metrics on the provided URL.

Here is an example with two endpoints:

```yaml
jobs:
  # via [unix_http_server]
  - name: local
    url: 'unix:///run/supervisor.sock'

  # via [inet_http_server]
  - name: local
    url: 'http://127.0.0.1:9001/RPC2'
```

For all available options, see the `supervisord`
collector's [configuration file](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d/supervisord.conf).

## Troubleshooting

To troubleshoot issues with the `supervisord` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

First, navigate to your plugins' directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on your
system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the setting `plugins directory`. Once you're in the plugin's directory, switch
to the `netdata` user.

```bash
cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
sudo -u netdata -s
```

You can now run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

```bash
./go.d.plugin -d -m supervisord
```
