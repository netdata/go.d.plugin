title: NVMe devices collector
overview:
  application:
    description: |
      NVMe (nonvolatile memory express) is a new storage access and transport protocol for flash and next-generation
      solid-state drives (SSDs) that delivers the highest throughput and fastest response times yet for all types of
      enterprise workloads.
  collector:
    description: |
      This collector monitors the health of NVMe devices using the command line
      tool [nvme](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli#nvme-cli), which can only be run by the root user. It uses `sudo` and
      assumes it is set up so that the netdata user can execute `nvme` as root without a password.
setup:
  prerequisites:
    list:
      - title: Install nvme-cli
        text: |
          See [Distro Support](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli#distro-support). Install `nvme-cli` using your distribution's package manager.
      - title: Allow netdata to execute nvme
        text: |
          Add the netdata user to `/etc/sudoers` (use `which nvme` to find the full path to the binary):
          ```bash
          netdata ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/nvme
          ```
