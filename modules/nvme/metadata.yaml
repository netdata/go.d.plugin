title: NVMe devices collector
overview:
  application:
    description: "NVMe (nonvolatile memory express) is a new storage access and transport
      protocol for flash and next-generation\nsolid-state drives (SSDs) that delivers
      the highest throughput and fastest response times yet for all types of\nenterprise
      workloads.\n"
  collector:
    description: "This collector monitors the health of NVMe devices using the command
      line\ntool [nvme](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli#nvme-cli), which can
      only be run by the root user. It uses `sudo` and\nassumes it is set up so that
      the netdata user can execute `nvme` as root without a password.\n"

  prerequisites:
    list:
      - title: Install nvme-cli
        description: "See [Distro Support](https://github.com/linux-nvme/nvme-cli#distro-support).
          Install `nvme-cli` using your distribution's package manager.\n"
      - title: Allow netdata to execute nvme
        description: "Add the netdata user to `/etc/sudoers` (use `which nvme` to
          find the full path to the binary):\n```bash\nnetdata ALL=(root) NOPASSWD:
          /usr/sbin/nvme\n```\n"
