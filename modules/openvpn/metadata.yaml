title: OpenVPN collector
overview:
  application:
    description: |
      [OpenVPN](https://openvpn.net/) is an open-source commercial software that implements virtual private network
      techniques to create secure point-to-point or site-to-site connections in routed or bridged configurations and remote
      access facilities.
  collector:
    description: |
      This collector monitors one or more OpenVPN servers, depending on your configuration.

      It uses OpenVPN [Management Interface](https://openvpn.net/community-resources/management-interface/) to collect metrics.
setup:
  prerequisites:
    list:
      - title: Enable in go.d.conf.
        text: |
          This collector is disabled by default. You need to explicitly enable it in [go.d.conf](https://github.com/netdata/go.d.plugin/blob/master/config/go.d.conf).
          
          From the documentation for the OpenVPN Management Interface:
          > Currently, the OpenVPN daemon can at most support a single management client any one time.

          It is disabled to not break other tools which use `Management Interface`.
