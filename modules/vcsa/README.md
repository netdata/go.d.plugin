# vCenter Server Appliance collector

## Overview

The [vCenter Server Appliance](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/com.vmware.vsphere.vcsa.doc/GUID-223C2821-BD98-4C7A-936B-7DBE96291BA4.html)
is a preconfigured Linux virtual machine, which is optimized for running VMware vCenter ServerÂ® and the associated
services on Linux.

This collector
monitors [health statistics](https://developer.vmware.com/apis/vsphere-automation/latest/appliance/health/) from one or
more vCenter Server Appliance servers, depending on your configuration.

## Collected metrics

Metrics grouped by *scope*.

The scope defines the instance that the metric belongs to. An instance is uniquely identified by a set of labels.

### global

These metrics refer to the entire monitored application.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

No action required.

### Configuration

#### File

The configuration file name is `go.d/vcsa.conf`.

The file format is YAML. Generally, the format is:

```yaml
update_every: 1
autodetection_retry: 0
jobs:
  - name: some_name1
  - name: some_name1
```

You can edit the configuration file using the `edit-config` script from the
Netdata [config directory](https://github.com/netdata/netdata/blob/master/docs/configure/nodes.md#the-netdata-config-directory).

```bash
cd /etc/netdata 2>/dev/null || cd /opt/netdata/etc/netdata
sudo ./edit-config go.d/vcsa.conf
```

#### Options

The following options can be defined globally: update_every, autodetection_retry.

## Troubleshooting

### Debug mode

To troubleshoot issues with the `vcsa` collector, run the `go.d.plugin` with the debug option enabled. The output
should give you clues as to why the collector isn't working.

- Navigate to the `plugins.d` directory, usually at `/usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/`. If that's not the case on
  your system, open `netdata.conf` and look for the `plugins` setting under `[directories]`.

  ```bash
  cd /usr/libexec/netdata/plugins.d/
  ```

- Switch to the `netdata` user.

  ```bash
  sudo -u netdata -s
  ```

- Run the `go.d.plugin` to debug the collector:

  ```bash
  ./go.d.plugin -d -m vcsa
  ```
